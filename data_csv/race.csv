1,Alolan,"You grew up in the tropical paradise of Alola. People there share a deeper connection with both Pok√©mon and nature. Your traditions and culture are completely different from any other region and you're proud of that fact. Alola is a tiny island nation to the South of Hoenn and South West of the Johto Region. They have only recently opened up to the rest of the world, and are relatively tiny compared to powerhouses like Kalos, Sinnoh, and the Kanto region. Don't let that fact fool you though. Due to their deep connection with nature, Alola houses some of the world's most talented mages, who are able to study and train with their Pokemon in a way no other region can provide.",0,0,0,0,2,1,null,null
2,Hoennian,"You grew up in the archipelagic region of Hoenn. From sprawling forests, meteoric craters, and open seas, you seem equipped to handle anything. Hoenn is a large region with a variety of different environments and cultures. Cumulatively, they are one of the largest nations in the world, but the archipelagic nature of the nation makes it difficult for it to be truly united, and it suffers in terms of international presence because of this fact.",0,0,0,2,1,0,null,null
3,Johtoan,"You grew up in the region of Johto. Rich in history and cultural significance, citizens of Johto usually share a deep connection to the history and traditions of their homeland. Unfortunately, Johto itself is a volatile and war torn nation. After rising up against the idea of a unifying Kantoan emperor, Johto fought for it's right to be a free nation, and now the Western portion of the continent is stuck in a power vacuum, with many warlords trying to claim the coveted spot of Johtoan emperor.",1,0,0,0,2,0,null,null
4,Kalosian,"You grew up in the region of Kalos. Dripping with natural beauty and a rich history, Kalos is a laid back region whose citizens are always ready to swap stories and show off their talents. Rich in natural resources, with an easy to unify layout, Kalos is currently in a golden age, enjoying a fleeting moment's peace from their numerous skirmishes with the Galarian region. They are a military and mercantile powerhouse.",0,0,0,0,1,2,null,null
5,Kantoan,"You grew up in the region of Kanto. With an affinity for learning and a world of possibilities in front of them, citizens of Kanto have been making their own way in life for as long as they've resided there. Currently, Kanto is a nation on the mend. Following their humiliating loss to Johto in the latter's fight for independence, the nation as a whole is simply focused on recouping their losses any way possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0,null,null
6,Sinnoan,"You grew up in the Northern region of Sinnoh. Used to unforgiving northern temperatures and environments, citizens of Sinnoh have iron wills, with strength of both body and mind. Far to the North of Kanto and Johto sits Sinnoh, the militaristic frigid North. A mountainous region, Sinnoh has no shortage of the natural resources needed for successful military campaigns. The region is a meritocracy run by a single king, though there are many noble houses who would see him fall. Aside from its metal exports, Sinnoh's main export is mercenaries, who are highly coveted for their skill and strength.",1,0,2,0,0,0,null,null
7,Unovan,"You grew up in the vast region of Unova. Filled to the brim with pioneering spirits and the hustle and bustle of large cities, Unovans generally come off as quick on their feet and sharp minded. A nation of united mercantile states, people are free to choose their own path in Unova. If you've got an idea you think can make a quick gold, then you've got a shot at making an easy million. Unova is the merchant capital of the world, and they use their vast lands to provide other nations with whatever it is they might need at the moment. Unovans themselves tend to do what they feel like when they feel like, and nobody will tell them otherwise.",0,2,0,1,0,0,null,null
8,Galarian,"You grew up in the secluded region of Galar. Used to doing things your own way, Galarians can come off as cold or intimidating. However that's often far from true. Cut off from the rest of their continent by harsh mountain ranges, Galarians have developed their own way of doing things. This small Northern nation has been united for a long while, often attempting to storm the Western mountains and claim some of Kalos' natural resources as their own. Galarians themselves are known to be a rowdy bunch, but well meaning once you get to know them.",0,0,0,0,0,0,null,null
